Javascript/Bootstrap
I used javascript to make an alert that says hi to the user, to allow the user to change the background color for
the body and header, to have the user answer a short quiz, to make a calculator, and to make a guessing number game
for the user to play. I used Bootstrap for the header on each of the four pages.
