                Hello everyone, my name is Jai Sarin. I am 17 years old in Moorpark, California and I am going to be a senior at <a href="https://mhs.mrpk.org/" target="_blank">Moorpark High School</a>.
                I am a very outgoing person and I like to spend time with my friends and family. I am also a very motivated, perseverant, honest, kind, and hard-working individual.
                Some things that I enjoy doing are playing games, watching movies, and coding. I have no pets but I do play two musicial instruments, the violin
                and viola. I have been playing the violin for about a decade and the viola for about a year. I also like to edit videos using video editing software and listen to music (favorite artists are Eminem, Biggie, Tupac, Dr. Dre, 50 cent, and Snoop Dogg).
            </p>
            <h3>Academics</h3>
            <p>
                My favorite subjects in school are math, science, strings, and history. However, I take all of my academics seriously, even english. I have excelled in all of my classwork and assignments, scoring 4's and 5's on AP exams.
                I have also gotten all A's in middle school and high school and as of right now I have a high school GPA of 4.55!
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Achievements/Extracurriculars</h3>
                Not only have I maintained a solid GPA and excelled on my AP Exams, I have also did many activities that showcase my talent. Here are the clubs and other extracurricular activies that I participated in.

            <h3>My Goals</3>
            <p id="font">
                My long term goals are to have a successful career where I can sustain myself and my future family.
                I plan to apply to the UCs and other top engineering schools to major in computer science to become a software engineer.
                I really like to code projects in my free time and I hope that I can continue that type of work as a profession.
                These goals are important to me because I really enjoy coding and I want to do it as a career.
                I feel like I would really enjoy going to work every day if I was able to code.
                Not only would I have a positive attitude about work, but I will also be working in a high-paying job, allowing me to pay any expenses I have and support myself and eventually my future family.
                Being able to support myself is very important to consider when applying for a job and I feel like I can best achieve this by being a computer scientist and software engineer.
