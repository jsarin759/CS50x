-- the theft took place on July 28, 2023 and that it took place on Humphrey Street

-- Description: Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery. Interviews were conducted today.
-- with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“ each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.
-- id number of the crime: 295

-- Ruth, id = 161: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you
-- have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Eugene, id = 162: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond, id = 163: As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard
-- the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other
-- end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

-- Now, lets take a chronological approach to solving the murder. First, we should identify all of the people that withdrew from an ATM on
-- Leggett Street. This query will allow us to see the account numbers of the people who withdrew money. Since the thief withdrew money on
-- the day of the murder at this ATM, one of these accounts belongs on the thief.

-- Now we need to find the people associated with the account numbers. This can be done in two steps. The first step is to identify the
-- ids of the people who withdrew accounts at the ATM on Leggett Street on the day of the crime. Then we can identify the people's actual
-- names associated with those ids. This query identifies ids of the people who withdrew at the ATM on Leggett Street on the day of the crime.

-- After completing this query, we now have eight suspects that could be the thief. However, more work needs to be done. Based on Ruth's testimony,
-- the thief left the bakery via car shortly after 10:15 am. Since we know the license plates for each individual, we can compare these license plates
-- to those found by the bakery's security logs to see if any of these plates overlap. The thief's license plate should overlap since they were at both
-- the ATM and bakery.

-- This query shows the bakery security logs on day of crime. Ruth mentioned that within ten minutes of the theft (10:15 am), the thief left the bakery,
